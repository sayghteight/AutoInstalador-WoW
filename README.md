# AutoInstalador-WoW

## Project Information
This project is scheduled shell, which makes the installation of all tools needed to wow your server 
in less than 6 minutes with just one command.

This project arises because of doubts that exist in many communities of Spanish and English speaking,

It includes many emulators but we may need to update every x time to add more cores.
